Maybe it's \"Stockholm Syndrome\". That's what they call it when you develop feelings of affection to your captors."

      'I recently learned about the animal from Earth, called "Octopus". It bears resemblence to our Syoisiach friends, and also is within comparison of their intelligence. Sadly, they don\'t live as long. That is probably why the humans dominate, despite only having the land available. It is amazing that most of the Earth is covered in dihydrogen monoxide.',
